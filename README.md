# Artificial-Human-Algorithm
Human beings are considered as the most intelligent species on Earth. The ability to think, to create, to innovate, are the key elements which make humans superior over other existing species on Earth. Machines lack all those elements, although machines are faster than human in aspects like computing, equating etc. But humans are still more valuable than machines, due to all those previously discussed elements. Various models have been developed in last few years to create models that can think like human beings, but are not completely successful. This paper presents a new theoretical system for learning, memory management and decision making that can be used to develop highly complex systems, and shows the potential to be used for development of systems that can be used to provide the essential features to the machines to act like human beings.
